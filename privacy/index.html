                        <h2>PRIVACY POLICY FOR WEBSITE 1221CAPITAL.COM</h2>

<p>1221 Capital, LLC, a Massachusetts limited liability company (referred to in this document as “COMPANY” or “We”), is concerned that its reputation and responsibilities in maintaining a website always remain of paramount importance in all of COMPANY’s activities. To that end, in addition to certain conditions and restrictions that you will find under the Website Terms of Use Agreement and Legal Disclaimer on our website http://www.1221capital.com (“website”), the information and links to other websites, if any, provided below explain COMPANY’s policy about privacy, options you can use to limit the use of information about you both here and elsewhere on the internet, valuable information about the internet generally, public policy issues about the internet, and internet privacy, as well as other information about rights and responsibilities concerning privacy in a variety of non-internet areas.</p>

<p>We believe in your privacy. Your privacy is important to you and to us. Therefore we will protect any information that you share with us. To protect your privacy, COMPANY follows standard principles in accordance with worldwide practices for client/customer privacy and data protection.</p>

<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

<p>COMPANY’s policy is to respect the privacy of all visitors to its website. The following policy statement tells you about what information we may receive, send, or ask of you, for what purpose such information is used, and some ways you can control the use of such information.</p>

<p>Generally, anyone may visit http://www.1221capital.com, and COMPANY will not keep information about these visits except potentially for a record of how many total visits have been made to the website and its various web pages altogether.</p>

<p>Should you desire to contact us electronically through the website, such contact requires the use and completion of an online form contained on our website.</p>

<h2>SECURITY</h2>

<p>The gathering of personal information on COMPANY’s website is limited to any information obtained through use of the electronic contact form found under the “CONTACT” link on the website.</p>

<p>Security measures are in place to prevent the loss, misuse, and alteration of the information that we obtain from you, but we make no assurances about our ability to prevent any such loss, misuse, to you or to any third party arising out of any such loss, misuse, or alteration.</p>

<p>Although COMPANY does not gather credit card information on the website, nevertheless in the event of unauthorized use of your credit card, you must notify your credit card provider in accordance with its reporting rules and procedures.</p>

<p>COMPANY strictly protects the security of your personal information. We carefully protect your data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>

<p>You also have a significant role in protecting your information. You should limit the sharing of your personal information only to trusted recipients of that information.</p>

<h2>NOTICE CONCERNING CHILDREN AND TO PARENTS</h2>

<p>We adhere to the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”). Any person using our website’s “CONTACT” form and providing any personal information must be at least eighteen (18) years of age or older. Our website follows the guidelines, policies and laws of the Federal Trade Commission of the United States of America (www.ftc.gov). We retain the right to refuse to allow anyone to use the website. If we learn or have reason to believe that a website User providing personal information is underage according to the guidelines, policies and laws of the Federal Trade Commission, we will promptly delete any personal information obtained from such person and disallow continued use of the website for that person.</p>

<h2>WHAT WE DO WITH THE INFORMATION YOU SHARE</h2>

<p>When you contact COMPANY through the website’s “CONTACT” form, you may provide us with your contact information, including your name and email address. We use this information to communicate with you, but COMPANY may also disclose some or all of your personal information, without notice, to third parties who performs functions on behalf of 1221 Capital or to 1221 Capital’s service providers.</p>

<p>Should COMPANY hire other companies to provide limited services on COMPANY’s behalf, including but not limited to programming, answering questions about COMPANY’s services, and / or sending email, we will only provide those companies the information they need for contact purposes, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.</p>

<h2>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

<p>COMPANY will disclose your personal information, without notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on COMPANY or the site;</li>
    <li>Protect and defend the rights or property of COMPANY and its family of Websites;</li>
    <li>Enforce our Terms of Use Agreement; or</li>
    <li>Act under exigent circumstances to protect the safety of the public or users of the Site.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Site may contain links to other websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of such websites. We may also make email services, bulletin board services, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, personal web pages, calendars, photo albums, file cabinets and/or other message or communication facilities designed to enable User to communicate with others (each a “Communication Service” and collectively “Communication Services”) available to you. Please understand that any information that may be disclosed in these areas, aside from the website’s “CONTACT” form, would potentially become public information. We have no control over its use and you should exercise caution when deciding to disclose your Personal Information anywhere aside from the website’s “CONTACT” form.</p>

<h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION-WHY AND HOW “IP ADDRESSES” ARE USED</h2>

<p>An IP address is a basic element of the way the Internet functions. It is a number that identifies your computer according to its IP address, and IP numbers are assigned to web sites automatically. IP addresses may also be identified in “header” information on emails. There may also be other services and occasions when IP addresses will appear. Always look carefully at what information may be displayed about you, including your IP address, and if you are unsure or uncomfortable about the appearance of your IP address, do not use that service.</p>

<p>In addition to being an important part of how computers communicate with each other correctly, IP addresses can be used for other things, as well. In COMPANY’s case, IP addresses may be collected for smooth operation in administrating our website system, for purposes of collecting the non-personal “grouping” information for use by COMPANY and certain third parties, as discussed above, and to generally monitor the use of http://1221capital.com. IP addresses are exchanged many times when you are surfing the web, so, for example, if you select a web page or link within COMPANY’s website, the IP address is recorded by the server by which COMPANY’s website is connected to the internet.</p>

<p>For most purposes, your IP address will not be connected with personally identifying information, only the fact of that access to a given place on our websites gets noted, but who you are individually will be anonymous, even to COMPANY.</p>

<p>However, as with certain information discussed in other parts of this document, IP Address information will be used to help us identify a person if COMPANY, in good faith, believes it important for ensuring proper compliance with our rules and policies, if it appears to be necessary to comply with laws and to protect COMPANY, our members and customers or other third parties.</p>

<h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>

<p>COMPANY is not responsible for other links that may be contained on the website, and you should only share personal information with websites, companies, or persons that you trust.</p>

<h2>OTHER IMPORTANT COMPANY PRIVACY ISSUES</h2>

<p>A “Cookie” is a small file sent to and stored in your computer to keep accurate records and customize certain services. In fact, it’s become so common that you can almost always expect cookies to be sent to your computer from a wide variety of Internet sites.</p>

<p>Should COMPANY’s website use cookies, such cookies would never be used for storing or accessing important personal information that you alone should control.</p>

<p>Even though cookies are usually thought to be helpful to web sites and their users alike, not everybody wants them being put in their computer. That’s okay, but there are two things you need to know: if you don’t have cookies, not everything on your COMPANY visits may be accessible, as efficient or as personable; and, stopping cookies is something we can’t do, instead you have to do it in your own computer.</p>

<p>Stopping cookies shouldn’t be difficult; however, because cookies are so commonly used and welcomed today, most browsers are set to automatically accept them. Even so, if you look through the settings in your browser, often in “preferences,” “setup” or “configuration,” you should be able to find a place where you can change the cookies setting, either to tell your browser never to accept cookies, or to tell your browser to notify you if a cookie is about to be sent and give you a chance to accept it or not. In the latter case, you should know that cookies are often just numbered or use some kind of computer term that will not be helpful for you to identify what the cookie is actually for so that you can make a clear choice, but the option is yours. If you want to learn more about cookies, a good place to start is to perform an internet search on“website cookies.”</p>

<h2>SPECIAL CONCERNS ABOUT HYPERLINKS</h2>

<p>In this document, there are buttons or underlined words and phrases that you can click on. You will find these throughout the website and nearly every other website you visit throughout the Internet as well. Some of them link to other parts of the same website, but others may send you to another website unrelated to the website you were at. This kind of link is called a hyperlink and could send you to a similar or entirely different website.</p>

<p>When we use hyperlinks on COMPANY’s website, we make best efforts to ensure that such hyperlinks are updated and accurate. However, COMPANY has no control over the business, operations or representations of these hyperlinks to unrelated websites, any hyperlinks included on them, or destinations such other websites may contain. COMPANY’s Privacy Policy does not cover other such destinations. You should always be careful at other websites about how they operate and how information is being used. Other websites likely have their own policies that differ from COMPANY’s, they may send different kinds of cookies, and they may gather and use information in very different ways than COMPANY.</p>

<p>We take no responsibility for the content contained on other websites. Therefore, always be careful about safety and security, including the safety and security of your personal information, whenever visiting any website. Once again, carefully protect personal information about yourself at all times, and be wary of who might obtain such information. Being careless with your personal information can be risky, and because COMPANY can’t control other hyperlinked websites or internet users, and because our own policies and rules don’t apply, the risk is on you to decide how, and how not, to use them.</p>

<p>By using this website, http://1221capital.com, you are verifying that you agree to, and will abide by, the terms of COMPANY Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF COMPANY’S PRIVACY POLICY, PLEASE STOP VISITING OUR WEBSITE.</h2>

<p>Second, please review our Privacy Policy periodically. Certain provisions may change over time, and we may include new information and privacy policies that will be placed in this document. If you continue to visit COMPANY’s website after any such changes, you will again be verifying that you agree to, and will abide by, the current privacy policy, as it then exists.</p>

<h2>UPDATES AND CHANGES TO PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

<p>We reserve the right, at any time and without notice, to add to, change, update, or modify this Privacy Policy, simply by posting such change, update, or modification on the Site and without any other notice to you. Any such change, update, or modification will be effective immediately upon posting on the Site.</p>

                    <p>The risk of loss is present in all investments, including Managed Futures. Our goal is to manage this risk by implementing proper money management techniques. Futures and options trading involves substantial risk of loss, therefore only risk funds should be used in such trading. Futures and options trading may not be suitable for all investors and investors should carefully consider their financial condition in deciding whether to trade or not to trade. Certain presentations make reference to several indices but only CTAs submitting their performance to these indices are included in that particular index. The performance of the index itself and the actual rates of return for an individual program may significantly differ and be more volatile than that particular index. Indexes themselves are not investable. Studies conducted of Managed Futures as a whole may not be indicative of the performance of any individual CTA. While Managed Futures can help enhance returns and reduce risk, they can also do just the opposite and in fact result in further losses in a portfolio. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance.</p>
